# Templates for competetive programming in C++

The aim of this repository is to store and share my templates that I use. I will try to keep updateing this repo as I learn new things.

I have used the templates from [this repo](git@github.com:rachitiitr/DataStructures-Algorithms.git) as a starting point.
